## Overview
    I created a simple ChatGPT application using the OpenAI API
    as a hands-on project to strengthen my Python programming skills
    and explore the pratical use of artificial intelligence.
    This app allows users to interact with a chatbot powered
    by OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo model

## AI Model Used
    OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo model (can be configured in the code to use other lla models) 
    

## Libraries 
    import tkinter - Used to create the graphic user interface (GUI)
    import openai  - Used to interact with OpenAI API
